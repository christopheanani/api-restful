Node.js, Express and MySql: Create a Restfull API

## What will you learn ?

What will you learn by downloading my code?

- Use of **express** to make API creation simple
- Field validation using **express-validator**
- Creation of a functional REST API with Node.js, Express and MySql.

Are you ready ? Let's go!

## Step 1: Installing dependencies

Clone the repository then run **npm install**

## Step 2: Link your api to MySql

Go to the **index.js** file and replace the database name **nodejs_etudiant** with yours.

## Step 3: Launch your project

To launch your project, just type the following command : **node app.js**. Your API will therefore run on port 3000

## Step 4: Test the API endpoints

This is an API that manages students. A student is characterized by:

- id: the student's id
- first name: the first name of the student
- last name: the student's last name
- faculty: the student's faculty

## Examples of API tests with postman (in pictures)
